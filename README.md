# American-Airlines-Performance-2018
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) publishes monthly information about airline on-time flight performance. Included in the monthly datasets is information about commercial domestic flights under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation. The detailed flight data includes information about scheduled flight times, actual flight times, length of departure delays and arrival delays, delay types, delay causes, and cancellations. Details about every flight in the monthly BTS are available to every airline â€“ i.e. any airline can evaluate their own on-time performance against every other commercial airline operating in the US.
